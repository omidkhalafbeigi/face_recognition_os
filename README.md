# face_recognition_os

This project, developed for my Operating System lesson. One of CNN difficulties, is that needs huge dataset (atleast 10000 samples for each class). So I forced to use Data Augmentation method for increasing pictures of my face. At the end, I had 5000 images of myself and 5000 images of celebrities. There are many datasets for celebrity images, like CelebAMask-HQ. But with almost 10000 samples, my model isn't very accurate and recoginizes many wrong images as me!. So we need more samples for training...
